# Bridge Girder Structural Analysis

This repository contains the screening task for the Osdag Internship. The project focuses on extracting structural data from NetCDF files and visualizing internal forces in 2D and 3D.

## 🚀 Features
- **Xarray Integration:** Efficiently handles multidimensional structural data.
- **2D Plotting:** SFD and BMD for the central bridge girder.
- **3D Visualization:** Interactive MIDAS-style force extrusion using Plotly.

## 🛠️ Installation
To run the code locally, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install xarray plotly matplotlib pandas netcdf4
